# Equal in your mind

As the doctor walked into the room, she held two case files in her hands, looking confused and bewildered.

*"You want me to operate on only one of them?"* she asked rather puzzled.

*"No"* came the reply calmly. *"I want you to operate on both of them, but only save one of them."*

*"I don't get it - if we have two patients, why not save them both?"* the doctor asked.

*"If there were time, we would. But there is no time - they will be here in less than five minutes, and you have a decision to make."*

The doctor looked even more confused.

*"But I don't have time to make a qualified decision..."* shed tried.

*"No you don't. 
You have to make a decision based solely on your intuition. 
I know you are not used to this, but time is on the essence here.
You are the best surgeon at this hospital.
I know you normally sit down at least 30 minutes with each patient's case file, if you can, and look up the best practice for the specific cuts.
But this is no normal case.
Only one of them gets to live, so if you have doubts you still have about... 4 minutes to ask them."*

The doctor had never been faced with such a challenge before.
This was both heart surgery *and* liver surgery.

*"But I have so many questions, if I need to make any good decision..."* the doctor started, but was cut short.

*"Time is on the essence here, doctor. So choose your questions wisely."*

The doctor just starred at the two folders for a few seconds.

*"But... okay, why was I chosen for this?"* the doctor started.
She had been employed for the past 5 months, and done quite a few operations - all successful, but always with time to prepare for each patient since they were all planned.

*"You are the best here - I already told you that."*

*"Okay, but why here? I have no problem with doing the actual surgery, but I've never done it on more than one person at the time, and I've never done transplants before!"* the doctor exclaimed.

*"There were two car crashes not so far from here, and this is the closest hospital. 
You know transplant is not that big a step from what you do on normal basis, and you have aced everything you've done so far."*

*"Okay"* the doctor said resignedly.
*"Then at least tell me what you know about them."*

There was a brief silence.

*"Are you sure you want to know?
You have to make a decision about saving one, but not the other.
I can tell you all about them, cause I know them both very well."*

There was a brief pause while the doctor swallowed hard.
To her, patients were just patients, but she had always been sure to come out successfully when she did it, even without supervision.
She had never given it much thought - that it was people from the rest of the society, and that it would have a great impact how well the surgery turned out.
Some could be back at work the next day, or the next week. 
Some could not be back before several months - or ever... and now she had to chose between two lives?

*"I am aware you are facing a hard choice, doctor.
But you need to figure out who to save."*

She just starred in disbelief.
*"But... but every life is equal..."* she started.

*"Is it?
Is your life the same value as the rest of this hospital's residents'? 
Compared to the newborn infant? 
Or the old man with stage 3 cancer? 
Or the nurse as the front desk?
And what are hers compare to the other two's?"*

It was a good thing the doctor had already sat down, cause her mind had never asked her those questions before.
Elder people had to go at some point, and young people had an entire life ahead of them.
But if you wasn't likely to survive on the table, there better be a good reason to try.
She had often run into people at the mall, in traffic, or at the hospital, she had not thought too high of. 
As a matter of fact, she had actually thought of saving everyone else but those, if she was faced with the choice of those assholes and literally everyone else.

*"OK"* the doctor started. 
That would be her way of judging, so she could at least ask about that.
*"What are they like?"*

*"The first is a selfish asshole who only cares for one person in the world, and the second is one I despise but wouldn't want to have been without."*

So much for that - a selfish asshole or someone you would despise?
The doctor rubbed the bridge of her nose a bit.

*"How old are they?"* She asked.

*"The first has his 50-year birthday tomorrow, and the second is 27"*.

Well, the first isn't all out yet, and the second should be at his physical peak right now.

*"You are running out of time, doctor. They will be here in one minute."*

*"Do you have any idea of what their individual survival rate looks like?"* the doctor outed as a last resort for decision making.

*"It's not the same operation they need, and they are not hurt equally bad.
It's about the same for both of them."*

That was about it for the doctor.	
*"How can you make me make such a choice? How can I make the right decision?"*

The sirens of two ambulances coming up to the hospital was now audible.

*"Well, you don't have anymore time left. But when what's left is right, and what's right is wrong - then only you can make the decision.
Let me know who you chose when it is over."* 

And the doctor just stood there, as if she was all alone in the room.
Then a knock on the door came from the nurse at the desk.

*"Doctor - they are here!"*

And the doctor left for her patients, know she would loose at least one of them.





# Aftermath

After the operation the doctor came back, and sat down.

*"So - who did you choose to save, doctor?"*

She didn't want to think about it. 
She couldn't say it.

*"Who did you choose?"*

*"You know who I chose"* the doctor hissed back.

*"I want to hear you say it, doctor."*

*"No - tell me about them first"* the doctor said in a firm tone, as she opened the two journals, and started looking at the content.

*"This morning a 911 responded to a call of a car crash. 
The car belonged to Marcus Nietz."*

The doctor thought for a moment, then said in realization: *"Doctor Nietz? The surgeon, who could 'could do anything'?"*

She had heard a lot about him - he was almost an icon to her.
Doctor Marcus Nietz was an inspiration, or at least he had been a few years ago, for his incredible work on patients. 
He had as good as perfect results on all of his patients, making surgeries on patients which made them walk again, or see again, or gain as good as full control with detached body limps.

*"Yes, the one and the same.
However, it was not doctor Nietz who drove the car - it was his son.
As soon as the paramedics found out, they contacted the next of kind - his only living family member - doctor Marcus Nietz.
His father dropped everything he had in his hands when he heard, and rushed to the hospital his son was taken to - although he, too, lost control of his car.
He crashed, and was rushed in here as well.
Doctor Nietz's heart were severely damaged upon arrival, and he would be needing a new heart - fast - if he was to survive. 
His son, however, was a drug addict who had his lever squashed to mush in his crash. 
He - too - needed a new fast, if he was to survive."*

A pause lingered in the room.
The doctor now remembered why Marcus Nietz wasn't her great icon anymore. 
He had become a dick to everyone, without comparison. 
He would show up at his work, perform near miracles on patients thought lost, and go home. 
But it wasn't because he had always been like that. 
Two year prior everyone had loved him. 
He had laughed, stayed to oversee patients being operated, and given advice to anyone who wanted to hear - which was almost everyone.
But it changed when his wife died, and he was left alone with his only son. 
After that, he didn't want to speak with anyone. 
He went to work, did only what was required of him, and went home without a word.
His son, the doctor had heard, had taken it way worse. 
He had quit the artist school his father had paid a fortune to get him into, and started taking drugs to escape reality.


*"We had no donors for any of the two. 
But since it was father and son, organs from one would fit the other.
It's a real tragedy.
This..."* which led the doctors attention to a picture of a display behind glass *"... is a Lister Medal - only given every third year to those who do outstanding work within the field of surgical science."*

As the doctor looked at the glass stand, she was taken aback, cause it was not only one medal, but 5 of them.
*"Marcus really did something no one else could do. 
He saved a great many lives on this planet."*

*"So patient number one was Marcus. 
You said the other patient was one you 'despised, but would wanted to have been without?'"* the doctor replied baffled, while she looked over the son's journal.
The doctor's heart skip a beat when she saw the photo of the painting in it.
The phrase 'a pictures says more than a thousand words' was most appropriate here, due to everything expressed in it. 

It wasn't just a painting showing a scene - it showed a story, but frozen in time.
It showed people at a funeral, with focus on two of them - a young man, and his father, each of them expressing grieve, though only the father had accepted a loss, while the young man was in a state of denial and rage, with a cross clenched in his hands so hard, that his knuckles had turned white, and the cross in his hand had started to bend. 
And the surroundings showed the young man's emotions - black void crashing bright light, like ocean waves from a storm, crashing towards the rocks of a lighthouse, twirling around the light, absorbing it, and overwhelming the source of the light.

*"Yes - the son, Frederic. 
It is sad, when people give up on their lives, and they start to pull others down with them. 
Especially when it is such good men as Marcus being dragged down. 
If it was only themselves they did harm to, and affecting no one else, the society would go on as usual - slowly improving here and there, making the world a better place to be alive.
But Frederic didn't just close his door, and weep in his bed. 
He fled reality with drugs he couldn't get from a pharmacy... no, he went to the streets to get what he wanted. 
And he did so for two years. 
He gave up completely on life, gave up his education, gave up on his friends and father, and spiraled down a long road of misery, which only left an ugly trail for those who tried to pull him up from there."* 

It sent a chill down the doctors spine, as she looked at the journals' content.

*"Marcus tried with shrinks, and doctors, but to no avail. 
He dragged his son to the church they have gone to their entire life, and had a priest talk to the kid. 
But the kid only stared grimly at him. 
Though he did give an answer a few days later, in the form of this painting. 
And when Marcus saw this picture, he, too, knew the son could not be reached by any means available to him. 
The son began painting as a form of expressing himself, so Marcus let his son be. 
He went back to what he knew he could, but found no joy in it - not in the job, not in coming home to his son, cause the only way the son spoke to him was with paintings. 
And each of them showed less and less light, and only more and more dark and gray colors."*

The doctor looked at some of the other paintings attached in the folder.

*"Marcus took the pictures to an art gallery, hoping a professional in the art of painting could decipher them, and tell him what his son tried to communicate. 
And the answer he got back from the professional was 'God is dead', to which the professional started interpreting the different colors and strokes to Marcus. 
Marcus started realizing, that his son had not only lost faith in God, but he had framed how mankind slowly turned from their faith in God, and just worked and worked, showing no love to one another - just facts and opinions, and everything got grayed out the longer it went on."*

She had a rough time processing all this new information. 
She might just have let the wrong patient live.

*"So, why wouldn't I want be without him, you might ask?
Marcus did so much good, but got anchored to his son. 
Frederic took Marcus with him - away from society, away from patients and colleagues who needed him and learned from him. 
It might not be Frederic's intention, but everyone were now without Marcus.
And still Frederic gave something to the world. 
He didn't cure people, he didn't give knowledge to anyone else, but he opened the eyes of those who looked upon his paintings. 
Although he didn't write or say it, he told them, that God was no more, and it was all our own fault. 
That is a contribution to mankind, that is not lightly forgotten. 
And each and every painting he painted tells the story more and more precise, just from other angles."*

The doctor had placed her head in her hands.
She had needed this before making her decision.

*"So who did you choose, doctor? 
Who are we without?"*

*"But I didn't know..."* the doctor started sulking.

*"Would you have chosen different if you did know, doctor? 
Everyone are equal, right?
So tell me - is the son without a father, or is the father without a son?"*

*"But... this changes..."* the doctor started.

*"It changes nothing.
One of them had to go, and you had to make the decision. 
You asked me of my opinion of them, and when you couldn't get a favorable answer, you asked what you thought could make up your mind - Were one of them too old, or would one of them be more likely to die at the table.
Would knowing their background have changed who you chose to save?"*

*"This wasn't fair!"* the doctor snapped back.

*"Oh, but it was, doctor. 
It was fair to both of them.
They both had an equal change of surviving.
You just had to choose."*

*"So..."* sniffled the doctor, *"when you said... that what is left is right... you meant it would be the same outcome?"* not looking anywhere but down on her knees.

*"I meant, that all that is left is right, cause saving one of their lives would be the right thing to do. 
But choosing 'right' would be wrong, cause now one of them is without the other, as we are all without them now.
So - who did you choose?"*

The doctor just stood up and left the room, leaving the journals behind.

As she got out, one of the nurses shouted after her:
*"What happened to the journals?"*

The doctor stopped, but didn't turn.
*"They... They are still in there."* And then she continued down the hall.

The nurse gave her a look of pity.
It wasn't the first doctor who had come out from that room in tears, and it might not be the last.
The room was for staff only at the hospital, so they could gather their thoughts after difficult operations. 

As the nurse entered, the dim light showed the small benches lined up on each side. 
There was room for perhaps 20 people in here, and the small table with a cross upon stood at the end of the small room.
The two journals lay open on the left side, showing pictures of some medals and some paintings.
The nurse scooped them up, and looked around.
"Well, it sure is quiet in here. 
I get why some of them come to think here. 
I can hear myself think."

And the nurse left the empty room.
