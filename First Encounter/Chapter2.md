# Chapter 2 (Work in progress) 

Jensen had no time to stand around waiting for whatever would come.
Their ship was being pulled into the aliens', and they couldn't do squat about it.
She had a pretty good idea of what would follow right after that happened, but right now she had a hard time preventing it from happening.

As she turned towards her only living crew member, she saw a look on his face indicating he was not present at all. 

"Wolashni" Jensen said with a tone you would only heard inside the military.
It yanked him out of a thought he apparently couldn't shake. 
"Sergeant - are you with me?" she continued in the precise pronunciation, but with a hint of worry in her voice.

Wolashni eyes flickered for a second, as he looked up and around, before finally settling his focus in the direction the command had come from.

"Jensen..." he started with a scared voice, and panic in his eyes. 
"Wha-". 

"Second Lieutenant Jensen" she cut in before continuing. 
"And if we stick to the chain of command, you let me make decisions so we both get out of this in one piece."
It wasn't so much an order, as much as it was a reminder that they had their ranks for a reason.
After the incident with Captain Miller, she had taken command of the vessel and shown she was more than capable of making the right decisions.

The Sergeant swallowed before shaking the grim thought he had just had, and reminding himself of the Second Lieutenant's words.
She hadn't let him down at any point up until now, and she was always two steps ahead of him when chaos surrounded them.

"Right" he started.
"I'm here. What do we do, Second Lieutenant?" came a much more firm, though very concerned reply.

A small smile curled up on the right side of Jensen's face.
This was the Sergeant she remembered.

"We have a few highly plausible outcomes within the next few minutes." she started without a hint of doubt.
"When they get us in their own hangar, they will most likely give us some time to open the door and get out to them, but we are not able to do so, and chances are they are well aware of that.
That means they will get to us one way or another."
Her voice's pitch didn't change a whole lot doing her speech.
As she spoke she floated towards the bridge with the big window - their currently only light source.

"If you were to make contact with another civilization, Sergeant, would you walk up in person to shake hand?" she continued, heavily hinting that would not be the case.

"Ehm - no" replied Wolashni after a short moment.
"I would send in a drone to get a look at them".


"So would I, Sergeant. But we are still in here and the drone out there - separated by the ship's exterior. 
What would you do about that?"

This question was way harder - mostly because he didn't want the ship to be damaged, so they at some point could fly out of here.
Wolashni bit himself in his lower lip while thinking of something but the obvious.

"Well, going through the hatch seems unlikely - it's not exactly visible unless you know it's there, and if you were to force it open you would destroy the mechanic since it has no power."
Wolashni looked up at Jensen who gave him a small nod before continuing.
"Since they would be able to see us through the glass, they might conclude this will be the easiest way into the ship and break that somehow."

An equally bad option, since they couldn't just get a replacement for the window.
The concern was all over Wolashni's face, but as he looked to the Second Lieutenant there was none to see.

"Correct on both statements, Sergeant" she began.
"Let's say, again, you found this new lifeforms, they had just started to fly away before you disabled their engine, and you *don't* want to rip their ship apart.
What options does that leave you with?"
She was now all the way up at the window to inspect the situation more closely.

"Ehm..."
Wolashni couldn't quite come up with anything, cause that kinda had to be it.
You would have to force your way in, since they couldn't get out on their own free will.
What other options were there?

Second Lieutenant Jensen turned her head towards him.
"Yes?" she started.
"You have *disabled* their power, Sergeant.
What happens if you turn it on again?"
She had a gleam in her eye which somehow signified this differently would be the case.

"But..." Wolashni interjected.
"When they do so, we could just fly away again?
Why would they do that, Second Lieutenant?"

She straightened her neck, as her eye brows both shot up a bit.
"Because... " she nodded towards the alien's spaceship.
"They have some huge arm to hold on to our vessel when they give us the power back."

As Wolashni got up next to her, he could see the place they were pulled towards indeed had some sort arms in there.
They didn't look metallic, but had an odd, dark purple nuance, and as they moved around it reminded Wolashni a lot of an octopus' arm.
Looking around in the "hangar" they were being pulled into, they could see other vessels that were held to the wall in the same fashion.
And to Wolashni's great relief none of them seemed harmed by the arms.

Jensen continued to explain in a more pleasant voice: "Either these aliens found other lifeforms besides us, and this is where they all go, or we are being pulled into to the same place all their own ships go."
She straightened up ones more, as she continued: "So - it would appear we won't be just sitting on our butts waiting for them to carve their way to us.
Time to say welcome one way or another when we meet them."

She turned around, and pushed herself away towards her desk, where pens, gadgets, and other objects floated around.

"How would think we should greet our new friends, Sergeant?"

It was one of those questions loaded with *I-know-do-you?* but Wolashni had to admit he would rather have these than the *are-you-stupid* ones.
