Jensen had no time to stand around waiting for whatever would come.
Their ship was being pulled into the aliens', and they couldn't do squat about it.
She had a pretty good idea of what would follow right after that happened, but right now she had a hard time preventing it from happening.

As she turned towards her only living crew member, she saw a look on his face indicating he was not mentally present at all. 

"Wolashni" Jensen said with a tone you would only heard inside the military.
It yanked him out of a thought he apparently couldn't shake. 
"Sergeant - are you with me?" she continued in the precise pronunciation, but with a hint of worry in her voice.

Wolashni eyes flickered for a second, as he looked up and around, before finally settling his focus in the direction the command had come from.

"Jensen..." he started with a scared voice, and panic in his eyes. 
"Wha-". 

"Second Lieutenant Jensen" she cut in before continuing. 
"And if we stick to the chain of command, you let me worry about making the decisions so we both get out of this in one piece."
It wasn't so much an order, as much as it was a reminder that they had their ranks for a reason.
After the incident with Captain Miller, she had taken command of the vessel and shown she was more than capable of making the right decisions.

The Sergeant swallowed before shaking the grim thought he had just had, and reminding himself of the Second Lieutenant's words.
She hadn't let him down at any point up until now, and she was always two steps ahead of him when chaos surrounded them.

"Right" he started.
"I'm here. What do we do, Second Lieutenant?" came a much more firm, though very concerned reply.

A small smile curled up on the right side of Jensen's face.
This was the Sergeant she remembered.

"We have a few highly plausible outcomes within the next few minutes." she started without a hint of doubt.
"When they get us into their own hangar, they will most likely give us some time to open the door and get out to them, but we are not able to do so, and chances are they are well aware of that.
That means they will get to us one way or another."
Her voice's pitch didn't change a whole lot doing her speech.
As she spoke she floated towards the bridge with the big window - their currently only light source.

"If you were to make contact with another civilization, Sergeant, would you walk up in person to shake hand?" she continued, heavily hinting that would not be the case.

"Ehm - no" replied Wolashni after a short moment.
"I would send in a drone to get a look at them".

"So would I, Sergeant. But we are still in here and the drone out there - separated by the ship's exterior. 
What would you do about that?"

This question was way harder - mostly because he didn't want the ship to be damaged, so they at some point could fly out of here.
Wolashni bit himself in his lower lip while thinking of something but the obvious.

"Well, going through the hatch seems unlikely - it's not exactly visible unless you know it's there, and if you were to force it open you would destroy the mechanic since it has no power."
Wolashni looked up at Jensen who gave him a small nod before continuing.
"Since they would be able to see us through the glass, they might conclude this will be the easiest way into the ship and break that somehow."

An equally bad option, since they couldn't just get a replacement for the window.
The concern was all over Wolashni's face, but as he looked to the Second Lieutenant there was none to see.

"Correct on both accounts, Sergeant" she began.
"Let's say, again, you found this new lifeform, they had just started to fly away before you disabled their engine, and you *don't* want to rip their ship apart.
What options does that leave you with?"
She was now all the way up at the window to inspect the situation more closely.

"Ehm..."
Wolashni couldn't quite come up with anything, cause that kinda had to be it.
You would have to force your way in, since they couldn't get out on their own free will.
What other options were there?

Second Lieutenant Jensen turned her head towards him.
"Yes?" she started.
"You have *disabled* their power, Sergeant.
What happens if you turn it on again?"
She had a gleam in her eye which somehow signified this differently would be the case.

"But..." Wolashni interjected.
"When they do so, we could just fly away again?
Why would they do that, Second Lieutenant?"

She straightened her neck, as her eye brows both shot up a bit.
"Because... " she nodded towards the alien's spaceship.
"They have some huge arms to hold on to our vessel when they give us the power back."

As Wolashni got up next to her, he could see the hole they were pulled towards indeed had some sort of arms in there.
They didn't look metallic, but had an odd, dark purple nuance, and with movement which reminded him a lot of octopus arms. 
Looking around in the "hangar" they were being pulled into, he could see other vessels that were held to the wall in the same fashion.
And to Wolashni's great relief none of them seemed harmed by the arms.

Jensen continued to explain in a more pleasant voice: "Either these aliens found other lifeforms besides us, and this is where they all go, or we are being pulled into to the same place all their own ships go."
She straightened up ones more, as she continued: "So - it would appear we won't be just sitting on our butts waiting for them to carve their way to us.
Time to say welcome one way or another when we meet them."

She turned around, and pushed herself away towards her desk, where pens, gadgets, and other objects floated around.

"How do you think we should greet our new friends, Sergeant?"

It was one of those questions loaded with *I-know-do-you?* but Wolashni had to admit he would rather have these than the *are-you-stupid* ones.

He closed his eyes briefly as he started to remember the official guidelines, which all said how a lot of humans would greet few of them.
There weren't any that came to mind of how a few humans would greet a lot of them.

"I... I don't know, sorry" he said a bit disappointed in himself.

Jensen sent him a raised eyebrow, as she grabbed a flowerpot which came drifting.
"How would you prefer to be greeted if you had just captured a new perform?"

"Ehm, I-I guess-" he started before he was interrupted.

"No need for guesses, Sergeant.
Our procedures for new lifeform greetings, although the other way around, are rather clear of how we should do this.
What do we expect of new lifeforms? 
How do we get the best, but also most realistic, scenario? That is how we should behave."

That made sense.
Wolashni did remember most of these scenarios - and unless the new lifeform showed direct hostility towards humans before they could get a closer look at each other, it was to be presumed they had good intentions.
Currently they had only tried to fly away, which properly wouldn't count as hostile, so they ought to still have good chances with this.

Most of the procedures for first encounter involved a drone to scout around, just to give a glance at what could be expected, and which precautions should be taken.
Unless the new lifeform was some small, cute entity, which had no chance of making actual damage to you, the ones making psychical contact was normally equipped with a blaster, or at least a stunner.
Military might was almost never encouraged, since history didn't tell great tales from this approach.
Therefore some discreet weapons was on the usual equipment list.

"So..." started Wolashni. 
"For precautions we should go with blasters, right?"
It was not like he was crazy for shooting anything that moved, but he had some real concerns about the aliens' technology. 
They could jump so close to them, and disable their engine so fast - they might as well assume they could do anything.

When Jensen rotated towards Wolashni, she still held the small flowerpot in her hands, and her facial expression made it rather clear she had some internal battles going on.
She sighed for a second before responding.
"I'm not saying we shouldn't, but I thought bringing them a gift of life would be better than laser beam of death".

Her face grew sharp again.
"But blaster was the second thing I thought of bringing.
Though that leads to another important question, Sergeant.
Who will shoot first?"

Wolashni was about to drop a name of some old movie character, but decided to hold that for another less serious situation.

"Well... I-I guess..." he initiated, before stopping himself again to think it through.
If the aliens got too close with too sharp objects, he would - wouldn't he?
Or if...

"Wolashni, I don't know why the answer from you is not immediately '*they will*'."
She was dead serious as she continued: "If they do not make an attack on you, you will not shoot, you will not point it, you will not even draw the blaster.
Our blasters are our last defense, and if we let them know we have means to defend ourselves successfully, they will also be on the edge.
The last thing we want with a technological superior race is starting measuring blaster size."
Her tone had slightly shifted from serious to threatening. 
"Chances are size means nothing to them, since they never think of themselves in any real danger - we are walking into a lion's cave, and the lights are out.
They have every advantage they could ever wish for, and the blasters are all we have as our last line of defense" she finished as she pointed towards her own stunner.

The fear Wolashni had shaken earlier suddenly started to crawl back, as he took in the situation the Second Lieutenant had described to him.
There were no need to remind what they would do in the reverse situation - this was exactly what they would do.

*'Never go unprepared'* was one of the quotes written over the door to their equipment room.
Wolashni had always interpreted this as 'never go without equipment', but suddenly the inscription had more to it that just physical supplies, like tactics and strategies for what were to come.

Wolashni nodded in agreement.
As he looked outside he noticed the light had grown more intense, and they were now as good as in the alien's hangar.

"Anything I can bring?" he asked with a serious tone.
He didn't want to look empty handed, although he had no idea how the aliens would interpret that anyway. 

Jensen alert level fell with those words, and with a calm voice replied:
"Bring a container with water - if we stay out too long and the oxygen level isn't suitable for us, we need something we can covert to breathing air."

Wolashni kicked off towards the equipment room, and quickly found what he was looking for. 
On his way back to the bridge he stopped briefly in front of the captain's room. 
He rested his hand on the door, and with a sigh muttered a quiet apology: 
"Geez Captain. 
I'm sorry 'bout all of this. 
I kinda wish you could see all of this, but I can't tell if it would be better or not. 
This is not what we prepared for, and I could really use your guidance right now. 
I know I have Jensen, but it's... 
It's just not the same, you know?"

He tapped the panel twice as a goodbye, and finished:
"... But we are gonna make it. 
She knows what to do - she always does."

As he glided back to the bridge, the alien's hangar filled the entire window - they were now no more than a few seconds from floating into their ship. 

"I like space walks from time to time" Jensen suddenly stated. 
"As they they say - '*in space no one can hear you scream*', but that's only true if you remember to mute your radio".
