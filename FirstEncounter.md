# Chapter 1

The face of Sergeant Wolashni was a picture worthy, as he starred at the enormous spaceship that had jumped out of hyperspace just seconds before. 
They had picked up something on multiple scanning devices just before that, but there had been no obvious pattern to any of it. 
They knew it wasn't anything humans had designed, cause none of the signals could be translated to anything useful, so when the sergeant had looked out the windows to wonder what it could be, he had not in his wildest imagination thought it wouldn't be themselves that would try tracking down the source, but the source coming to them.

"Se-Se... Second Lieutenant... " Wolashni stuttered.

Deeply absorbed in the blinking screens, Second Lieutenant Jensen didn't move her attention in his direction, but kept tapping different points on the displays.

"I'm trying to make sense of this signals, sergeant. Perhaps you wouldn't mind giving me a hand?" came the reply a bit annoyed.

Wolashni considered the multiple witty comebacks she had warned him, on several occasions, to never make any of again. 
He almost always had a great comeback, at least according to himself, but right now he didn't really know how to phrase one.

Jensen pulled a graph up on the big screen, and threw her hands in the air resigning. 
"I don't get it!" she almost yelled in frustration. 
"The signal - the exact same signal - got sent with a 4 minutes delay, but the signal strength increased so much, it-".

"Could be right outside?" offered Wolashni, still in half shock of what he was starring at outside the 12 cm thick glass, separating the three man crew from the previous void and empty space, and the current - at least - 100 times bigger spaceship looming no more than one or two clicks away.

Jensen's eyes almost blazed with a fire she had kept at bay while Captain Wilson had still been able to commander the crew, but after he had passed the responsibility to the next in line, her, she no longer felt these undisciplined replies should go with just verbal reminders.

She slowly started to turn, with her nostrils open wide as the only source of air, since her lips were pushed together in a thin line.

"Wolashni..." she started slowly, with a voice so cold it could have made ice taps from her breath alone. 
"Your impeccable timing of silly comebacks have at no point - not once - since we left the Mothership over 5 months ago, had any luck to cheer up any of the crew members on this vessel" she hissed out. 
Her gaze were somehow distant as she started to recall the impossibly stupid comments he had breathed in dire situations that could have killed them all - not due to the comments, but they always seems to follow grim situations.

As her mind came to that realization, a chill went through her bones. 
"Did you loose a radio on your last walk outside, Wolashni, and the floating device is what I will see when I look outside?" 
Her eyes could have shot laser beams like those in comic books when her head finally locked in on Sergeant Wolashni's one foot taller figure.

As his own comprehension of the new situation became less surrealistic, he glanced back to his superior in command, tried to find the words needed to defend himself of an actual plausible accusation, but since he had no situation to relate this to, he had nothing clever to say.

"N.. No..." he started, lifting his index finger towards what multiple sources normally referred to as First Encounter.

"It's ehh..." he continued, swallowing the spit which had gathered in his mouth. 
"It bet... wor... mmm" - he couldn't quite decide which of the two. 
The Fleet had trained and drilled all for their cadets for hours and hours of how they should encounter new lifeforms. 
And all of their training had been how humans found other lifeforms - not the other way around. 
When a superior civilization would meet another less superior, history spoke with a clear voice of America's discovery, the Roman Empire, and the Mongol Invasion. 
The intend of the superior civilization usually dictated the outcome of the meeting. 
And right now their own vessel looked like a peanut compared to what had emerged out of the bare nothing.

"It's... that" he finally said slowly, while the Second Lieutenant made her way towards the large window with a now puzzled expression on her face.

"It's wha..." she started and abruptly stopped, her eyes wide, mouth gaping, and frozen in place.

As she flabbergasted started to find words or action, Wolashni finally found his.

"I know, right?" he said giving his superior a light push with his elbow.

The Second Lieutenant had prepared herself for many things when she joined The Fleet, both physically and mentally. 
The Fleet had some sort of natural separation of gender - a lot like other military branches - where very few women would take the more "footwork heavy" jobs, but rather have paper pushing duties or human relation matters to attend to. 
The way too energized flyboys flew out in the black void, reported back, and greater expeditions would be organized to investigate the reports.

The Second Lieutenant had her rank for a reason though. 
It was earned through that footwork, her discipline, and her attention to details - the last something a whole lot of her colleagues would sometime skip on.

If Sergeant Wolashni had come up with the silly idea of capturing a picture of the Second Lieutenant, it wouldn't have been shock or fear he would have captured, but rather an expression of a person who was about to accomplish their biggest achievement. 
She had a look on her face which somehow reminded him of a cartoon villain who just watched all of his convoluted schemes come to fruition, and everything that was planned to happen just ticked like clockwork.

This expression lasted for about 3-4 seconds, before a new, and more concerned, look appeared, and Second Lieutenant started worrying about the complications the Sergeant had run through his own mind just before - they had the same training after all.

"Sergeant" the Second Lieutenant said short and firmly, as she kept her eyes on the new situation outside their ship a few seconds longer. 
"Send Message 42A to Central with our coordinates, and request a Representation Delegation..." she glazed around the alien ship for exterior that seemed hostile. "... -B" she finished.

The Sergeant had shifted his attention entirely towards the Second Lieutenant, but not with the military grade discipline she had expected, but with a surprise of the words his superior had just given him.

"B?" he almost shouted back. "You can't be serious, Jensen! That thing is-" he continued before he was cut off.

"It's Second Lieutenant to you, Sergeant Wolashni" Jensen's voice cut through as she turned her head towards him. "And that is the exact reason you will transmit that message ASAP with no questions asked!"

"But-" started Wolashni, but to no avail, before the Second Lieutenant cut him off again - this time turning towards him.

"The only 'but' will be your butt getting in gear, Sergeant, cause that was an order." 
Although she was a head shorter than the sergeant, the look in her eye and her imposing voice apparently did the trick, and when Sergeant Wolashni half-ran to the control panel, she turned her gaze back at the newcomers, which hadn't done anything but show up. 
They hadn't dispatched smaller ships, send signals, or the likes. 
This might be a peacef- she started thinking, as their ship suddenly started to turn. 
Her head snapped back at the Sergeant whose fingers were leaving the navigation panel.

"Why are we moving Sergeant?" she asked half in disbelief, half knowing the answer.

"Representation Delegation B my ass, Lieutenant" he replied with concern in his voice, not even looking in her direction. 
"We sent this ship out exploring - and it's like the smallest we have. 
They most likely did the same, and look at its size!"

The Second Lieutenant had never thought of Sergeant Wolashni as a very reliant individual, but should anyone ever had asked her if he was a coward, she would not have said 'yes' out right. 
But she couldn't say that anymore. 
Though right now that was not her greatest concern - far from.

"Sergeant - Disabled the engine!" Her command was sharp and precise. 
They had mere seconds before they would make a jump.

"Or what, Jensen?" Sergeant Wolashni spun his chair around, putting a hand over the navigation panel. 
"They can't capture us if we jump! 
What are they-" he started, before all of the systems outright died, and all light but what was coming from the window, vanished.

Jensen eyes didn't even look around the ship to figure out what had just happened. 
It was obvious to both what, and why it had, but right now they had only the oxygen that was inside the chamber, cause everything was out. 
As the artificial gravity vanished, the both started floating from the floor, and she kicked off towards their sleeping chambers.

Wolashni, on the other hand, had not grasped the situation.

"But... I-I-I just... Jensen?" he started, as he tried to hold on to the control panel. 
"What happened? Where are you going?" his panicking voice rang behind her.

Jensen took a second to cool down mentally. 
"I'm going to survive - you can tag along as long as you don't get me killed too" she replied cold as she glided through the ship.

They had been on this vessel for months with only space walks to 'stretch their legs', so every corner of the ship was familiar to them. 
Jensen reached her chamber, and started equipping her space suit.

"But..." started Wolashni. 
"I just set the course of ship - how could that..." but he didn't get to finish before Jensen sighed out loud as she was about to explain something dead obvious to a five year old for the third time.

"Sergeant - if these aliens are anything like us, they just found life in space" she began. 
"The sent us a signal which we does nothing but look at, they most likely grow impatient, and warp to us to get a better look" she continued in her mildly overbearing tone, which then changed to an annoyed growl: 
"And what is that new lifeform's first reaction?" 
She was looking at him, while she worked her way into her suit.

"Ehm - I... They..." Wolashni began.

"They try to run!" Jensen exclaimed. 
"So how do you prevent the newly discovered lifeform from doing that?"

Wolashni had finally caught up with the situation. 
"You EMP-blast them" he said quietly.

"YOU EMP-BLAST THE HELL OUT OF THEM" Jensen summed it up in loud frustration. 
"And how does that leave us oxygen-wise?" she asked, although it was now like second nature to Wolashni.

As he started float towards his own chamber across hers, he replied defeated: 
"Limited to what won't get EMP-effected."

"And how many people on this ship needs electronics to have a chance to survive?" rang Jensen's voice through the dead silent ship.

Wolashni froze in shock for a short moment, as the realization hit him. 
He had not considered the bacta-tank Captain Miller was kept in. 
Although he had as good as no chances of survival before, they were now all gone.

"If you are wondering, Sergeant, the correct answer is now two" Jensen continued. 
"Cause this time you can be damn sure he won't be getting better!" she said with the last three words mocking Wolashni stupid comment when the accident had occurred.

The Second Lieutenant floated into his chamber in full suit, now speaking through the speaker of her helmet. 
"Are you ready, Sergeant? 
Cause we are most likely about-" she started before a force yanked in their ship, sending both of them bouncing into the ceiling.

"What - what happened?" began Wolashni frightened.

The Second Lieutenant gave her response with the same annoyed tone she had earlier: 
"The new lifeform attempts to flee, so you EMP-blast them. 
They now float around in space like an asteroid. 
What do you do?"

"Ehm" started Wolashni, as he floated back to his suit.
"I-I send a ship to push it-", but didn't get any further before he was interrupted.

"You have a huge ass ship, with all the equipment you need! 
The object can't resist, and it's just outside your hangar bay. 
What do you do?" Jensen said monotonous, though growing impatient.

"I..." Wolashni struggled for words. 
This wasn't his area of expertise - he was an explorer, not a technician. 
When they had docked at the Mothership, they just flew up close enough, and they were just pulled... 
"Tractor beam?" he finished on a small, high note.

"Yahtzee" replied Jensen in a grumpy tone, her mind elsewhere. 
They now had a First Encounter, and it was not going according to book.
