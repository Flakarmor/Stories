___

Adrex didn't understand it.
Installing the gear on-premise was a pretty common way to treat customers, but something most definitely didn't sit well with his master.

"You think it's a bad thing he contracted us to do?" he asked.

The dwarf kept her eyes locked at his for another few seconds, before she firmly walked to the door, locked it, and held up her right index finger.
Her voice sounded almost like a song, falling from a high note:
"Let's tak' it from th' top, eh?"

She turned around, gestured to Adrex' chair to sit, and walked towards her own as she continued.

"In came a to-be client.
He first asked me if this wa' the right place, and he had som' delicate, custom trap he wanted t' have done.
All'n all a standard client, and tha's when I called fer' yeh".
Her tone where soft as she spoke, and nothing seemed unusual to Adrex thus far.

She pulled her chair out behind the counter, and continued a bit sharper: 
"Just befer' yeh came, however, he asked 'bout the name of the place - did you hear that part?" 

"Yes..." Adrex had had his attention to the conversation from here, and he was a bit unsure why it had transpired as it had.
"He asked about the name - Hammer & Scale - and after he'd realized I was dragonborn, you were kinda up in his face?"

She dropped her hand down on the table.

"Oh, com' on, Adri" - her name for him over the years, and went on frustrated:
"Tha' arrogant prick was in the process of mocking th' shop's name, which happens t' be named after us.
Nor' only did he assume ay was 'Hammer' since ay'm a dwarfÂ´, and yeh t' be 'Scale' since yeh a dragonborn. 
Tha' rasist bastard immediately assumed wha'ever yeh had in yeh hand was some'n endangering him."

She clearly didn't like him, and - yes - he had noticed the reaction in Morenfein's face, but her reaction still seemed a bit too aggressive.

"We've had rich snobs in 'ere before - yeh remember that Galloway guy we did the sleeping dart trap for, right?
He fuck'n mocked yeh for being dragonborn!"

At some point Adrex had stopped counting stupid people they had met, who didn't understand the difference between evil, hoarding dragons, and dragonborns.
That guy wasn't even the last to accuse him of things he, his family, or his race had ever done, but that was the time he had started trying ignore them, and let Yurgunn do the talking - she always had some sharp comebacks, so Adrex could only hope to accumulate some for later.

"Yeah, but this guy actually apologized-" Adrex started, before Yurgunn cut him off.

"He continued ta' mock both our physical appearances as'n excuse, and that's where ay draw tha' line!" she said, point her finger down into the counter.

She drew her breath to calm herself down a bit.

"I've lived 'ere in Hupperdook for th' past 18 years, lad.
This city consist mainly of gnomes, so most of 'em been calling me 'big girl', and 'tally', and the elfs, humans, and other-" she held her hands up as quoting "- 'normal sized' living here all say 'shorty' to me.
But new folk comin' inta' our shop, and starts picking on your height as well... 
I ain't having it."

At this point Adrex had kinda lost what was left of a good day.
The mention of his height was really something he didn't feel like talking about.
Compared to his parents, uncle, and brother, who all ranged between 6" to 6"5' feet tall, Adrex was but 5"5' himself, and it didn't seem like he would ever get higher -  something which really bugged him.

His parents had said, that his egg had been mishandled when they fled by some of the authorities, and that might have done it, but that he shouldn't think too hard about it - he was 'way smarter than was taller', whatever that meant. 
Those properties wasn't comparable.

But he hadn't picked up, that the elf had mentioned the height differences.

"Was that why you called him..." Adrex didn't remember the exact word she had used - *Crit, crek?*

Yurgunn raised her left eyebrow.
"When a' called 'im 'crick'? 
Ay - that' was why."

She squeezed her eye a bit, as a worried frown came across her forehead.
"You know what a 'crick' is, right?"

Adrex thought he had heard it before, but he wasn't sure in what context.
He leaned his head back a bit, as he looked up into nothing to recall it.

A horn sounded over the city of Hupperdook, signaling the work hours had passed, and the inns and taverns were opened.

She looked out the window.

"Yeh in a hurry today?" she asked him.
"Meet'n someone?"

That was borderline rhetorical, but a nice gesture - he might be, but unlike other young adults who could get alcohol in the bars, Adrex never really enjoyed his time between the noisy crowd of mostly halflings who all seemed to have it out for his tail as soon as he turned just the slightest.
The conversations he had wasn't exactly inspiring either, since all the drunk people ever did was complain, and dance some wild dance tapping their boots, or stretching their leg as far in front of them as possible - which also ended up in someone complaining about his size and tail.

There were the twins of cause - the two female humans who worked with their father in his shop.
One was pretty and... not so smart, while the other had a lot of knowledge in their common field of interest, but looked like she always slept with her face on a hard surface. 
They were friends, for sure, but their company was to be enjoyed in small doses.

Adrex inhaled, and sighed ever so slightly, looking towards the city as fireworks started to shoot into the air.
Yurgunn took this as a pretty clear answer.

"Well, time for a hist'ry lesson then" she said, as she reached to a cabinet behind her, which among other things contained a few bottles for this time of the day.

"Boulderhead Bock or Hardroot Cider?" she asked him looking towards him with just one eye.

He wasn't fond of the alcohol itself, but the Boulderhead Bock wasn't like most of the thin beers served by the gnomes - it had volume, and tasted nice. 
And even though it made him a bit numb at the fingers, it was still one of the few beverages with alcohol he enjoyed.

Only forming the sound of the letter 'b', Yurgunn reach in for the Boulderhead Bock, and with a swift movement tossed it to him, which he caught with a little effort.

As she pulled out one for herself, she continued where she had ended.

"Crick" she started, as she wrinkled the cork from the bottle with a small 'pop'.
"So, a long time ago when the Ashkeeper Peaks alone wasn't enough to hold back the Krynn empire towards the east, the ol' Julius Dominion had some wars with 'em.
When the Dwendalian Empire took over the Julius Dominion about 200 years ago, there where some disputes between Dwendalian and Krynn soldiers as well.
No matter which age you fought the Krynn, they have always been referred to as 'cricks', due to the sound their battle armor has..."

She looked Adrex, who had opened his beer with some difficulties, and sat with a face of confusion.
Yurgunn took a swig, and clarified:

"Their armor are designed to make a noise of crickets when they move.
It's some sort o' battle tactics, or what-not, and is associated with the chitinous... beetle like armor, which our new client wore beneath his cloak."

She held a pause - it didn't seem to have a reaction on Adrex.

"He is from Xhorhas, most likely" she pushed.

Adrex finally took a good sip at his drink, still not catching onto what she was implying.

"Yeh uncle, Donaar - he's in the council of th' city, right?" she then tried.

*Odd turn of topic*, Adrex thought, but nodded while the bottle was still at his lips.

"Have he spoken 'bout how things a' going lately east of the Ashkeeper Peaks?" she continued.

Adrex had to think back a bit.
His uncle talked a lot - mostly about politics, and why someone always was in his way of creating a better world, so Adrex could name a few of the local politicians who were considered 'dumb, selfish, and small-minded', as his uncle Donaar so politely had called them over and over again.
But not so much of what happened east of the mountains.

He lowered his bottle as he swallowed, shacking his head.

Yurgunn tossed her bottle's cork to the trash bin.
"It's shit, to say it without wrapping it in."

Adrex' right eye shot up, pondering how severe it actually was.
Before taking another mouthful he asked:

"And with 'shit', you mean...?"

Yurgunn sat her beer down, and said "It's so bad, that I've had to redirect the military recruiter who came here to somewhere else, while you made the business go around."

Adrex' train of thought caught up rather quickly to what that meant, spitting out what was left of liquid in his mouth over the counter.
*A military recruiter? This was bad!*

Yurgunn's eyes calmly followed the fountain that sprayed over the counter and floor, as she casually picked up the cloth Adrex had come in with, handing it to him.
She would have preferred to have kept that secret, but things were in motion, and with a binding contract she could at least tell the whole truth to him.

"So just to be clear - you agreed to create a 'trap' for the Krynn Empire, which can neutralize a foe so fast they can't even teleport out, and it must be as mobile as a bow."
Her tone were flat, as she took another swig of her bottle.

Adrex' mind was racing.
*WHAT HAVE I DONE? I should never have agreed to this - this might have been the worst trade deal in history. 
This could be used against against anyone.*

As Adrex took the cloth and began running it over areas that *could* have been sprayed, his master took another swig - the conundrum of how to handle the situation had been firmly planted in him.

"But that's not all yeh did, lad. 
Yeh agreed to go, in person, and deliver it to him.
And while yeh were at it, yeh need to give a presentation of it." 

Adrex' mind had stopped working.
*What in Bahamut's name have I done?*
He stopped his cleaning and just sat down on the floor with his head in his hand, resting on his knees.

*I can't give them this. 
Well, it's not giving - they pay money for it, but still!
If I give this to the Krynns, and they invade the Dwendalian Empire, it could  turn the tide to their side... Unless...*

Adrex looked up at Yurgunn.

"We are two about this" he exclaimed.
"If I build something, you know how it works."

She sat the bottle down on the counter and swallowed. 
"True - go on."

"Well, If we sell it the Krynns, we could also sell it to the Dwendalians, right?" Adrex continue.

The eyes flared up in the dwarf's head, as she stared at him for a long second.

"Yeh'a genius, Adri!" she exclaimed.
"Did I teach you that - I don't know - maybe..." she said out loud to herself before she looked up at Adrex again.

"That's *a lot* of money, my dear friend!
We co' be more than just rich! We could-"

She stopped mid-sentence, pondering something.

"Could we live with that?" she finally asked, staring Adrex dead in the eyes.
"Depending on what we come up with, could we live giving the world this creation?"

There was worry to detect in her voice, as Adrex slowly nodded thoughtful.

"Well" he started.
"It all stands and fall on what we invent, I guess.
If we somehow create what has been specified, it will be extremely valuable to everyone who wants everyone else harmed.
You could argue that's our line of business, but usually we try to keep someone out of something.
This thing can be used actively to... well... depending on what it can do."

Yurgunn made her way to Adrex, and sat down next to him.

"Depending o' what we' make, sure."
She took another swig as she leaned up against the, to her, huge dragonborn next to her, handing him the bottle.

"You know" she said, as Adrex took a sip.
"... If we sell the rights to make these with a cost per creation - tha' could be a lot of money" she said with a smile on her face.

Adrex glanced down towards her.
It certainly could.
If just every tenth soldier needed something like this.
*Oh yeah - this could be a gold mine without comparison*.

He tapped the bottle a few times with a thoughtful face.
"So... how do we make it?"
