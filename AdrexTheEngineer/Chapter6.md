When Yurgunn came back to the shop with the new equipment, she could see Adrex most certainly had not taken time to feel sorry for himself.
All wheels and cogs were gone from the workbenches, replaced with a weight, parchments, small bowls, strings, a lot of tubes, saws, and drills.

Her apprentice was fiddling with some parchment and a tube, as she sat the bag at the table, her face clearly showing she was trying to figure out what it all was for before asking.

The bag had not settled on the table, before the dragonborn had snatched it, and taken out the small containers with the refined niter in.

"O'ight, Adri' - fill me in this time... before *we* do it" she said, pushing the last part a bit.

As the container popped open, Adrex flipped his notebook to her with the recipe for black powder.

"We are making black powder, and the potassium nitrate you just collected, along with the sulfur, are what do most of the job.
We just need to mix it with some charcoal, and we could start make fireworks our self."

"Are we ta' make fireworks for the twins?" his master followed, confused but also a bit judging.

"No, I ehh..." Adrex started, as he gathered his thoughts.
"I went up to the twins, they were upset because of a letter, and had started fixing the issue.
We talked a bit back and forth about a rocket can only have so much powder before it blows up, and I suggested they send it up through an explosion in a tube, and the rest could be ignited with a fuse."
As he looked over to Yurgunn, he could see her eyes wide open, to which he hurried to add: "- and we agreed they could have that idea, if I could make a prototype for them."

When Yurgunn spoke, the disbelief was clear:
"Yeh' suggested them ta' make a canon with explosive balls?"

Adrex had a hard time countering it, as he puffed out some air through his mouth, looking at nothing in particular.
"Well, it sounds harsh when you say it like that..."

Yurgunn took another look at the tubes, picked one up an arms length, and held it from her hip in one hand and horizontal outwards with the other.

"We are making cannons you can carry..."
Her head started nodding, as her mouth made an grin.
"A' like it, Adri'. 
That could be a great way to fulfill the contract!"

Her smile faded, as she held the tube in her hands, starring at it at bit bewildered.

"So, how do yeh' intend to make tha' work?
Yeh' gonna fill some powder in a tube with only one end open, and then place the explosive ball afterwards?" she said, curious more than judging.

Adrex looked up from the containers, and nodded.
"Yeah, something like that", he said plainly, his attention still on the materials.

A more skeptical frown could be seen on Yurgunn's face now.
"So lets say yeh' close this end", she started, pointing to the tube, "yeh' fill it from the other end, and let it slide down, aigth?"

Adrex had started weighing the white powder on the weight, confirming with a distracted "mhm".

Yurgunn glanced at the workbench to all the tools.
"Can A' assume yeh' will drill a hole at tha' end to ignite it, just like a cannon?"

Carefully placing more powder on the cup on the weight, Adrex confirmed once more with the same sound.

"Then please tell me how yeh' intent to fix the problem of flipping the tube upside down" she replied, as something that was dead obvious to everyone, as she flipped the tube 180 degrees, letting the end she had pointed to be straight up in the air.

Adrex let the weight settle, as he reached for a small tube next to him along with some parchment.

"Well, the idea was, that it all goes down the tube as one unit" he started, taking some parchment, placing it above the tube's end, gently stuffing it down with a finger, before he pulled it up again.
In his hand he now had parchment with folds perfect to the tube.

"If we put powder at the bottom, the explosive ball on the top, and seal it all with the parchment, that could slide right down the tube.
Afterwards we can prick a hole into the side of the unit once it is inside the tube, put the fuse in there, and it should keep it in place".

He looked at his master, to the parchment, and back to Yurgunn. 
"I hope" he added somewhat uncertain.

If it wasn't for the height difference between the two, Yurgunn would have tilted her head forward, with an eyebrow raised to give him 'that' look, but instead she shook her head twice before adding: 
"A tiny fuse like that won't hold anything."

She inspected the tube again, and continued:
"But if we are just makin' something for test purpose, this would do tha' trick.
Besides - it would be way too expensive, if yeh' needed to buy a tube each time. 
But the twins gotta crack tha' nut themselves."

She looked to Adrex.
"Should I heat up the forge, so we can have this pipe sealed, then we drill a hole afterwards?"

Scratching his chin wondering how he missed the problem flipping the tube, he nodded, and continued to measure the powder.

10 minutes later the temperature in the workshop had risen quite some, and Adrex had mixed what his recipe had specified.
He now had a small bowl full of black powder, which left every surface covered in the charcoal ingredient's black dust.

From the forge flowed a steady heat, and the satisfied dwarf stood holding a tube with a seal end in a tong, with a smile as wide as she could.

"Tha' shou' do it, Adri'!" she exclaimed, as she dipped it into a bucket of water to cool it down, hot steam rising into the air.

Adrex had found the drill and was ready when Yurgunn the tube to the table.
Slowly turning the handle, not applying too much pressure, he carefully drilled into the side of the tube.

"Alright" Adrex said, nodding a bit to himself as the drill made it through to the center.
"Now we just need some powder inside"
