When Yurgunn came back to the shop with the new equipment, she could see Adrex most certainly had not taken time to feel sorry for himself.
All wheels and cogs were gone from the workbenches, replaced with a weight, parchments, small bowls, strings, a lot of tubes, saws, and drills.

Her apprentice was fiddling with some parchment and a tube, as she sat the bag at the table, her face clearly showing she was trying to figure out what it all was for before asking.

The bag had not settled on the table, before the dragonborn had snatched it, and taken out the small containers with the refined niter in.

"O'ight, Adri - fill me in this time... before *we* do it" she said, pushing the last part a bit.

As the container popped open, Adrex flipped his notebook to her with the recipe for black powder.

"We are making black powder, and the potassium nitrate you just collected along with the sulfur is what does most of the job.
We just need to mix it with some charcoal, and we could start make fireworks our self."

"Are we ta' make fireworks for the twins?" his master followed, confused but also a bit judging.

"No, I ehh..." Adrex started, as he gathered his thoughts.
"I went up to the twins, they were upset because of a letter, and had started fix the issue.
We talked a bit back and forth about a rocket can only have so much powder before it blows up, and I suggested they let it blow up through a tube, and the rest could be ignited with a fuse."
As he looked over to Yurgunn, he could see her eyes wide open, to which he hurried to add: "- and we agreed they could have that idea, if I could make a prototype for them."

When Yurgunn spoke, the disbelief was clear:
"Yeh' suggested them ta' make a canon with explosive balls?"

Adrex had a hard time countering it, as he puffed out some air, looking at nothing in particular.
"Well, it sounds harsh when you say it like that..."

Yurgunn took another look at the tubes, picked one up an arms length, and held it from her hip in one hand and horizontal outwards with the other.

"We are making cannons you can carry..."
Her head started nodding, as her mouth made an grin.
"I like it, Adri!"
