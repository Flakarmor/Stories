"Bye mom, bye dad, bye Uncle Donaar!" Adrex shouted over his shoulder, as he rushed through the door with his satchel over his shoulder.
Today was a new day - with new opportunities to explore, investigate, and engineer.
He had a plan for the day, and he was excited to get to working.

As he walked with a hasty speed towards the city, he had started humming [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hHfDTVgs0Q) he had heard one time in a tavern, performed by a traveling group:

"*Hupperdoo-oo-ook, Hupperdoo-oo-ook*

*We set the course for Hupperdook.*

*Hupperdoo-oo-ook, Hupperdoo-oo-ook*

*The wind leads us to Hupperdook*"

They had been playing on violin, lutes, accordion, flute, and an odd box which had set the beat. 
And they had all been singing as the song went on. 
The mood was at its peak that night in the tavern, no doubt about it.

Almost dancing his way through the door under the sign that said "Hammer and Scale", his dwarven colleague raised both an eyebrow and a smile seeing him.

"Well, well - someone's in e' good mood, eh?" she greeted him.

"... to Hup-per-dook" Adrex finished, as the music in his head finished.
"Indeed, a good day" he continued.
"And good morning to you, Yurgunn."

"Care te' share wha' got yeh' so high up t'day?"
She had a smile on her face, seeing Adrex so happy and lively. 
Normally he sat with his face buried in notes, writing, calculating, and mumbling to himself.

"Absolutely" Adrex replied, fumbling in his satchel, before he made a pause, looking a bit around for nothing but his own thoughts.

"Point of order: gears, then rockets", as he took of his back, and went to the workshop in the back.
"Come - you have to see them in action".

As he walked past Yurgunn, she lit up even more:
"Uh, yeh' got 'em working?" she exclaimed.

Adrex turned his head with a grin on his face. 
"Oh, did I".

As he took the last few steps towards the bench with his setup, he stood a bit to the side, so Yurgunn could see what he had made. 
He let the lead piece hang to the ground, which made everything spin a few degrees, as it got loaded.

"So - as you can see - the plate is pushed up by this spring.
The spring, when pushed down, will let go of this lever, which releases the break of these gears.
They are set in motion because of this piece of lead dragging them down, and because of the size of the gears, it will only drop a few inches, but spin the gear over here..." Adrex had to check at his notes, just to be sure.
"... 8 times, before the gears lock again by the lever and the spring".

He stood for a moment looking at it all, nodding to himself, before Yurgunn interrupted his inner fanfare.

"Yeh' tell'n me, tha' tha' plate being pushed down, will only make this stone drop a nudge, but spin this gear 8 times, before it's ready again?"
Her tone was a combination of disbelief and amazement, so Adrex just took a step back, and opened his hand towards the plate as a gesture for her to try it.

She had one of her expressions on her face where he could almost hear her say "really now?", and as she walked around the table, she held her hand above the plate with a stretch finger, still looking at Adrex.

Adrex nodded twice, as she pressed it down with narrow eyes.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click* - in that order, as the gear spun from the drag of the lead piece, letting it fall just a few inches, as the plate raised itself again, and the lever snapped into place, keeping the gears in check.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*.

Yurgunn's finger kept pressing the plate, with a visibly excited facial expression.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"Eh's like a toy, Adri!
A' could keep press'en this buttom all day."
She was like hypnotized of it.

Adrex folded his arms, rather proud of what he had made.

"I didn't get to try it much yesterday, but the math is solid" he said with a smile on his face.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"So, wha' would yeh' say this could be used for?" Yurgunn asked, as she sat down in a chair next to the table, looking him in the eyes.

"Well, there's the obvious trap, that keeps reloading" Adrex started.
"Then there's-"

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"-the..." Adrex had a hard time not grinning, as Yurgunn pressed the plate again.
"eh - the gears can spin an exact amount of time, which-"

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

The dwarf didn't take her eyes from his, and her face were without a change, as she clicked the plate again.

"... could - hehe - make two devices work in-"

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"Yurgunn, pl... please stop." 
Adrex had a hard time containing his laughter and frustration, as the dwarf kept her eyes on him, as she pressed the plated another time.

"I'm list'ning, Adri" she said without a change in her face.

"... In synchroniz-"

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"Yurgunn-"

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"Please, I-"

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

Adrex couldn't contain his laughter any longer.
It was funny, but it was also annoying beyond anything he had tried for a long time, and for each press, a shiver shot out through his bones, making him weak in his knees, and left a feeling he had to rub away.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"Hihi - stop it, Yurgunn - hihi. 
I- I can't..." Adrex actually couldn't stand up anymore, and his knees gave in under him, as he fell to the ground giggling like a little kid.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"Wha's tha', Adri?" the dwarf said with tone of wonder, but a mind only out to tease him.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

It was like a dozen of small insects crawling around inside his bones, making every joint in this body have a need to be rubbed.
And it kept getting worse and worse for each click.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

*Click, zzzz, du-duk*

The lead piece hit the ground.
Adrex' knees were still itching along with his elbows, hand wrists, ankles, and shoulders, and he was still giggling, though less audible and more focused on rubbing his joints.

"Looks more la' yeh' mad' a toy, Adri" the dwarf said with a big grin on her face, as she turned back to the setup to study it further.

"Of cause we can use it fo' traps - tha's obvious" she said, with her face up close to one of the gears. 

"Yeh started t' say somethin' 'bout e' makin' a certain amount of spin, and somethin' about two devices, eh?"

Adrex had finally gather himself enough to get an arm up at the table to help him up from the floor.

"Yeah, the gears turn in perfect unison - they cannot not be exactly where you expect them to be with the math.
They don't skip a cog - even though they are so small."
He was still rubbing his wrists as he got up.

Yurgunn had raised an eyebrow at this moment, as if an idea had struck her.

"Wha' 'bout tha' Tinkertop fam'ly?
They might be in need of som'n like this?" 
She looked back to Adrex, who had tilted his head a bit to the side.

"We could get 'em over to see the pos'bilities, and sell 'em the schematics, ya?"

Adrex liked the sound of that. 
If Cleff Tinkertop and his daugther, Rissannya, would buy it, then they could sell it to others as well.

"Yeah", Adrex said, nodding his head while scratching the back of his head.
"That sounds like a plan.
Do you want to setup the meeting today?"

Yurgunn clapped the table, as she started walking towards the door.
"No time t' waste!
We've money t' make."

She suddenly made a halt, before entering the front of the store, as she turned a worried face towards Adrex.
"Yeh' said som'n 'bout rockets before?"

"Yeah, I have been thinking about the mobile trap from yesterday, and I think I came up with a..." 
He had to find a phrase for it.
"... possible path to investigate.
Rockets are the stepping stone."

Yurgunn didn't seem less worried by that statement, but started nodding.
"Yeh' wan' t' send som'n like rockets towards the target?" 

She wasn't convinced at all by the look on her face.
"Ya - tha' most indeed be a stepping stone.
I need t' hear more about it later.
First, I'll head over t' Tinkertop and ask if 'e wan' to com'n have a look a' this", she said nodding her head towards the bench and its setup, "and then we'll talk more 'bout rockets, ya?"

She was already about to leave through the front door, as Adrex called out to her: 
"You won't mind, if I stop by the twins for some research, right?"
That usually wasn't a problem.

"Just don't tell 'em the secrets this time!" came a stern reply.

It *usually* wasn't a problem - for a reason.
When Adrex got an idea and people propped him about it, he had a hard time holding back about how it would work. 
And that was half of their business - selling functional ideas, and turning these ideas into actual solutions for clients.

Well - that meant he had an hour or two, before a demonstration was needed.
