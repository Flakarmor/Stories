"Bye mom, bye dad, bye Uncle Donaar!" Adrex shouted over his should, as he rushed through the door with his satchel over his shoulder.
Today was a new day - with new opportunities to explore, investigate, and engineer.
He had a plan for the day, and he was excited to get to working.

As he walked with a hasty speed towards the city, he had started humming [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hHfDTVgs0Q) he had heard one time in a tavern, performed by a traveling group:

"*Hupperdoo-oo-ook, Hupperdoo-oo-ook*

*We set the course for Hupperdook.*

*Hupperdoo-oo-ook, Hupperdoo-oo-ook*

*The wind leads us to Hupperdook*"

They had been playing on violins, lute, accordion, flute, and an odd box to keep the beat. 
And they had all been singing as the song went on. 
The mood was at its peak that night in the tavern, no doubt about it.

Almost dancing his way through the door under the sign that said "Hammer and Scale", his dwarven colleague raised both an eyebrow and a smile seeing him.

"Well, well - someone's in e' good mood, eh?" she greeted him.

"... *to Hupperdook*" Adrex finished as halted to the music in his head.
"Indeed, a good day" he continue.
"And good morning to you, Yurgunn."

"Care te' share wha' got yeh' so high up t'day?"
She had a smile on her face, seeing Adrex so happy and lively. 
Normally he sat with his face buried in notes, writing, calculating, and mumbling to himself.

"Indeed, I will" Adrex replied, fumbling in his back, before he made a pause, looking a bit around for nothing but his own thoughts.

"Point of order: gears, then rockets", as he took of his back, and went to the workshop in the back.
"Come - You have to see them in action".

As he walked past Yurgunn, she lit up even more.
"Uh, yeh' got 'em working?" she exclaimed.

Adrex turned with a grin on his face. 
"Oh, did I".

As he took the last few steps towards the bench with his setup, he stood a bit to the side, so Yurgunn could see what he had made, as he let the led piece hang to the ground, which made everything spin a few degrees, as it got loaded.

"So - as you can see - the plate is pushed up by this spring.
The spring, when pushed down, will let go of this lever, which releases the break of these gears.
They are set in motion because of this piece of led dragging them down, and because of the size of the gears, it will only drop a few inches, but spin the gear over here..." Adrex had to check at his notes, just to be sure.
"... 16 times."

He stood for a moment looking at it all, nodding to himself, before Yurgunn interrupted his inner fanfare.

"Yeh' tell'n me, tha' tha plate being pushed down, will only make this stone drop a nudge, but spin this gear 16 times, before it's ready again?"
Her tone was a combination of disbelief and 'this is amazing', so Adrex just took a step back, and opened his hands towards the plate as a gesture for her to press it.

She had one of her expressions on her face where he could almost hear her say "really now?" and as she walked around the table, she held up her hand above the plate with a stretch finger, still looking at Adrex.

Adrex nodded twice, as she pressed it down with narrow eyes.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click* - in that order, as the gear spun from the drag of the led piece, letting it fall just a few inches, as the plate raised itself again, and the lever snapped into place, keeping the gears in check.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*.

Yurgunn's finger kept pressing the plate.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"Eh's like a toy, Adri!
A' could keep press'en this buttom all day."
She was like hypnotized of it.

Adrex folder his arms, pretty proud of what he had made.

"I didn't get to try it much yesterday, but the math is solid" he said with a smile on his face.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"So, wha' would yeh' say this could be used for?" Yurgunn asked, as she sat down in a chair next to the table.

"Well, there's the obvious trap, that keeps reloading" Adrex started.
"Then there's-"

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"-the..." Adrex had a hard time not grinning, as Yurgunn pressed the plate again.
"eh - the gears can spin an exact amount of time, which-"

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

The dwarf didn't even take her eyes from his, and her face were without a change, as she click the plate again.

"... could - hehe - make two devices work in-"

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"Yurgunn, pl... please stop" Adrex could barely contain his laughter and frustration, as the dwarf kept her eyes on him, as she pressed the plated another time.

"I'm list'ning, Adri" she said without a change in her face.

"... In synchroniz-"

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"Yurgunn-"

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"Please, I-"

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

Adrex couldn't contain his laughter any longer.
It was fun, but it was also annoying beyond anything he had tried for a long time, and for each press, a shiver shot out through his bones, making him weak in his knees, and left a feeling he had to rub away.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"Hihi - stop it, Yurgunn - hihi. 
I- I can't..." Adrex actually couldn't stand up anymore, and his knees gave in under him, as he fell to the ground giggling like a little kid.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"Wha's tha', Adri?" the dwarf said with tone of wonder, but a mind only out to tease him.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

It was like a dozen of small insects crawling around inside his bones, making every joint in this body have a need to be scratched.
And it kept getting worse and worse for each click.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

*Click, zzzz, duk*

The led piece hit the ground.
