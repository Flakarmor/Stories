The sound of more fireworks flying in the air, busting into different colors had become so mundane, that Adrex didn't even bother to look up at it.
*Work hard, and party hard* had become the motto of the city, and it was quite fitting.

12 hour work days was the norm here, compared to... well everywhere else, as far as Adrex had heard.
Hupperdook was the factory of the Dwendalian Empire, and for the long hours to work, the council of the city had pushed for making it the norm to also celebrate the long days - booze was cheap, the legal drinking age was when you started working 12 hour shifts a day, and it was in no way frowned upon to still be partying at 3 in the morning.
After all - the barkeepers had 12 hour too, just shifted compared to most other in the city.

Another rocket went up not too far from Adrex - it took a bit longer to go off, and burst into a large, silver ring of glistening sparkles, followed by a cheer from the launchpad from where it had been shot up.
Adrex looked in their direction.
He had tried to send some rockets up - it wasn't expensive in Hupperdook, and they had quit an export of it to the rest of the empire. 
The twins made and sold fireworks, and although it was a competitive business here, they mainly focused on shipping to elsewhere - the price was higher, but they didn't have to make as much of it.

They had explained that they really had to focus on two things, which they separated between them; They made fireworks that didn't blow up in your face, and they made instruction manuals that was as clear as day.
Apparently they had received a lot of complains about people getting injured who where not used to using fireworks - mostly from stupid people, they had added.
Some had stood no longer than a few feet from an exploding rocket, while other had even held it in their hand, as the fuse ran its cause and the rocket started to fly away.

"It's dangerous, but we try to make it safe" one of the twins - Victoria - had said.
She wrote manuals far longer than any normal person would ever need, but she and her sister - Smearchuckle - really couldn't afford more lawsuits against people *who thought* that was how to use them.
Adrex had to roll his eyes just thinking about it.

As he continued walking from their own shop and home, another rocket went up with much more power than usual.
Adrex turned his head as he kept walking, just to see if-

**BOOOM**

It went off far earlier than anticipated, and sent a shower of red, blue, and green sparkles flying around the nearby houses, and even some just a few feet from Adrex, to which he instinctively dropped to the ground, knees curled up to his chin, and arms protecting the rest of his face.

Common for all rocket was, that they flew as long as they had powder, before they went off. 
You could normally hear how the powder ran out, before the inside of the rocket exploded into colors of various pattern. 
This rocket had *not* used all it's powder before it blew up, and it might have been loaded, and from the intense sound it gave off to start with, it had a lot to carry up, if it was not evident from the explosion he had just witnessed. 

Adrex hadn't been hit, but it was damn close.
As he looked up and around, he could see scorch marks on the ground near him from small burning balls the rocket had carried.

"Sweet Bahamut - thank you" Adrex mumbled beneath his breath, as he got up, dusting the dirt from his clothes.
Doors swung up with curious, although careful, people came to see what the huge explosion was about.
It had been both loud and nearby, and if there was anything entertaining, there would be a crowd to watch.
But besides the scorch marks, all the action was gone, as far as Adrex could see.

A voice from one of the patrons in the nearby in reached Adrex' ear:
"Was that your doing, dragon?" 

As Adrex looked in the direction, a stubby bearded gnome stood in the doorway with a mug spilled bear on his own shoe, a facial expression of both disgust and hatred, and a few of his buddies behind him.

He ignored the question from the gnome, continuing towards his home.

The voice continued, now louder than before:
"Don't you think we all know it was you, you overgrown iguana!
But keep walking, would you! 
We don't want you here"

*I hereby relieve you of your right to existence, you racist ankle biter* Adrex thought to himself, as the shouting became less and less audible.
Now in a foul mood, Adrex starting walking faster.

*Why can't they just keep their face shut?* he thought as he kicked the nearby pebble.
*Why does he even think it's OK to say that out loud?
There should be a freaking law against that shit!
A tour in Gearhold Prison would really serve idiots like him - just for a few days.*

Adrex kicked the pebble a bit further.

*He should be target practice for rockets!
Instead of up in the air, he should be strapped to an archery target, and you just fire towards h-*

Adrex stopped his line of thought, before the next took over:

*Shoot with a rocket?
Have it fire away in the direction you point, hit the target...*

He had a feeling he was onto something here.
This might be what he and Yurgunn needed for their mobile trap.

He started a fast walk home, his mind racing of what to do, what would and wouldn't work, and after thinking a bit about it, he realized he didn't knew enough about rockets to actually say what would work.

*We don't need a huge explosion, just a small one, but instead of fireballs it could explode with shrapnels.
And perhaps we can put some feathers on it - just like an arrow - so it will fly more straight. 
We really need precision here.*

*And a short fuse for instant rocket start - yeah, that might do it.
But what about the jet stream behind the rocket, which pushed it upwards? 
You would get burned...*

It was not perfect. 
He had to consider how to handle this safely.
Perhaps he could swing by Victoria and Smearchucle tomorrow and have a chat about it. 
They might be able to show him the inside of their work.

As he came further away from the city, the houses started to thin out, and he took a turn off the road towards an old mill.
It wasn't in use anymore as a mill, but instead served as a house for a dragonborn family, who had come twenty years ago as refugees with a minimal amount of personal belongings, asking for a place to stay.
Adrex was born here, and had never known his family's previous house or city, and talking about Draconia always made the mood drop a bit.
The extension to the side housed his dad's workshop, and the top of mill was his uncle's 'sanctum', as he liked to call it - it wasn't that they weren't allowed up there, they were just instructed in not to touch what was glowing with anything but a normal candle flame.
Adrex' room was in the basement, next to his brother's room. 

As he reached the door of the old building, he called out:
"Mom - dad - I'm home!"

He found his key, put it in the key hole, and pushed a hidden panel at the top of the framework he and his dad had installed, to which the door clicked open, letting him in. 
He inhaled the welcoming smell - a mix of stew his mom was cooking, and small bit of fine sawdust which couldn't be kept out of the rest of the house.

The inside of the building was all covered in fine wooden facades his dad had made over the years, which made everything seem really nice and expensive.
The kitchen and dinning room on the ground floor took up most of the space, and the spinal stair case led up to their common room, and the sleeping quarters for both his parents, and for his uncle.

In the kitchen his mom stood humming at the stove...

**NOT DONE YET**.
