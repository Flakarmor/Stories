The sound of more fireworks flying in the air, busting into different colors had become so mundane, that Adrex didn't even bother to look up at it.
'*Work hard, and party hard*'' had become the motto of the city, and it was quite fitting.

12 hour work days was the norm here, compared to... well everywhere else, as far as Adrex had heard.
Hupperdook was the factory of the Dwendalian Empire, and for the long hours system to work, the council of the city had pushed for making it the norm to also celebrate the long days - booze was cheap, the legal drinking age was when you started working 12 hour shifts a day, and it was in no way frowned upon to still be partying at 3 in the morning.
After all - the barkeepers had 12 hour too, just shifted compared to most other in the city.

Another rocket went up not too far from Adrex - it took a bit longer to go off, and burst into a large, silver ring of glistening sparkles, followed by a cheer from the launchpad from where it had been shot up.
Adrex looked in their direction.
He had tried to send some rockets up - it wasn't expensive in Hupperdook, and they had quite an export of it to the rest of the empire. 
The twins made and sold fireworks, and although it was a competitive business here, they mainly focused on shipping to elsewhere - the price was higher, and they didn't have to make as much of it.

They had explained that they really had to focus on two things, which they separated between them; They made fireworks that didn't blow up in your face, and they made instruction manuals that was as clear as day.
Apparently they had received a lot of complains about people getting injured who where not used to using fireworks - mostly from stupid people, they had added.
Some had stood no longer than a few feet from an exploding rocket, while other had even held it in their hand, as the fuse ran its cause and the rocket started to fly away.

"It's dangerous, but we try to make it safe" one of the twins - Victoria - had said.
She wrote manuals far longer than any normal person would ever need, but she and her sister - Smearchuckle - really couldn't afford more lawsuits against people *who thought* that was how to use them.
Adrex had to roll his eyes just thinking about it.

As he continued walking from the shop towards his home, another rocket went up with much more power than usual.
Adrex turned his head as he kept walking, just to see if-

**BOOOM**

It went off far earlier than anticipated, and sent a shower of red, blue, and green sparkles flying around the nearby houses, even some just a few feet from Adrex, to which he instinctively dropped to the ground, knees curled up to his chin, and arms protecting the rest of his head.

Common for all rocket was, that they flew as long as they had powder before they went off. 
You could normally hear how the powder ran out, before the inside of the rocket exploded into colors of various pattern. 
This rocket had *not* used all it's powder before it blew up, and from the intense sound it gave off to start with, it had a lot to carry up, if it was not evident from the explosion he had just witnessed. 

Adrex hadn't been hit, but it was damn close.
As he looked up and around, he could see scorch marks on the ground near him from small burning balls the rocket had carried.

"Sweet Bahamut - thank you" Adrex mumbled under his breath as he got up, and dusted the dirt from his clothes.
Doors swung up with curious, although careful, people who came to see what the huge explosion was about.
It had been both loud and nearby, and if there was anything entertaining, there would be a crowd to watch.
But besides the scorch marks, all the action was gone as far as Adrex could see.

A voice from one of the patrons in the nearby inn reached Adrex' ear:
"Was that your doing, dragon?" 

As Adrex looked in the direction, a stubby bearded gnome stood in the doorway with a mug spilling beer on his own shoe, a facial expression of both disgust and hatred, and a few of his buddies behind him.

Adrex ignored the question from the gnome, continuing towards his home.

The voice continued, now louder than before:
"Don't think for a sec'n, that we don't all know it was you, you overgrown iguana!
But keep walking, would you! 
We don't want you here!"

*I hereby relieve you of your right to existence, you racist ankle biter*, Adrex thought to himself, as the shouting became less and less audible.
Now in a foul mood, Adrex starting walking faster.

*Why can't they just keep their face shut?* he thought as he kicked the nearby pebble.
*Why does he even think it's OK to say that out loud?
There should be a freaking law against that shit!
A tour in Gearhold Prison would really serve idiots like him - just for a few days.*

Adrex kicked the pebble a bit further.

*He should be target practice for rockets!
Instead of up in the air, he should be strapped to an archery target, and you just fire towards h-*

Adrex stopped his line of thought, before the next took over:

*Shoot with a rocket?
Have it fire away in the direction you point, hit the target...*

He had a feeling he was onto something here.
This might be what he and Yurgunn needed for their mobile trap.

He started a fast walk home, his mind racing of what to do, what would and wouldn't work, and after thinking a bit about it, he realized he didn't know enough about rockets to actually say what would work.

*We don't need a huge explosion, just a small one, but instead of fireballs it could explode with shrapnels.
And perhaps we can put some feathers on it - just like an arrow - so it will fly more straight. 
We really need precision here.*

*And a short fuse for instant rocket start - yeah, that might do it.
But what about the jet stream behind the rocket, which pushed it upwards? 
You would get burned...*

It was not perfect. 
He had to consider how to handle this safely.
Perhaps he could swing by Victoria and Smearchucle tomorrow and have a chat about it. 
They might be able to show him the inside of their profession.

As he went further away from the center of the city, the houses started to thin out, and he took a turn off the road towards an old mill.
It wasn't in use anymore as a mill, but instead served as a house for a dragonborn family, who had come twenty years ago as refugees with a minimal amount of personal belongings, asking for a place to stay.
Adrex was born here, and had never known his family's previous house or city, and talking about Draconia always made the mood drop a bit.

The extension to the side housed his dad's workshop, and the top of the mill was his uncle's 'sanctum', as uncle Donaar liked to call it - it wasn't that they weren't allowed up there, they were just instructed not to touch what was glowing with anything but a normal candle flame.
Adrex' room was in the basement, next to his brother's room. 

As he reached the door of the old building, he called out:
"Mom - dad - I'm home!"

He found his key, put it in the key hole, and pushed a hidden panel at the top of the framework he and his dad had installed, to which the door clicked open, letting him in. 
He inhaled the welcoming smell - a mix of stew his mom was cooking, and small bit of fine sawdust which couldn't be kept out from the extension to the house.

The inside of the building was all covered in fine wooden facades his dad had made over the years, which made everything seem really nice and expensive.
The kitchen and dinning room on the ground floor took up most of the space, and the spinal stair case led up to their common room, and the sleeping quarters for both his parents, and for his uncle.

In the kitchen stood his mom, humming near the stove, slicing something to mix into the stewpot.
Dressed in her midday-blue dress and a white apron, she turned her head slightly as she continued slicing what was in front of her, her tail tip waved a bit from side to side.

"Welcome home, dear." she replied with the soft, warm tone, as she gently eyed him.
"How was your day?"

As she continued to prepare the food, Adrex brushed his feet in the door mat, and started prioritizing the day's events.

"Well..." Adrex started, dragging it a bit as the greatest impacts oddly seemed to be the most negative.

If there ever came a time when he could hide his feelings from his mother, it would be far in the future, cause she stopped her cyclic motion on the cutting board, turned her attention towards him, her head bowed a bit forward to meet his level, and with eyes that could tell what had transpired.

"Another one?" she simply asked.

Adrex bumped his head from side to side.

"Well, Yurgunn explained our new customer's actions, so it would actually be two in one day" he sighted, as he pulled a stool out and took a seat at the table, placing both of his elbows on the table, resting his face on his knuckles.

"Was he drunk?" his mother tried, which were the most common cause this conversation ever took place.

"No" Adrex replied a bit sad. *Not that it would have made it that much better if he were.*

"The second one was though.
The first one had just never seen a dragonborn before, and..."

They had had this talk over and over, and it was the same they saw each time.

His mother placed a caring hand on his right shoulder, as she moved up behind him, laying her chin the the side of his head, giving him a supporting hug.

"The eyes, the hesitance reactions, and staggering speech?" she tried categorize it to.

"Absolutely the eyes and the reaction, but..." 
Adrex sighed once again.
"I was in the back making - oh yeah" he interrupted himself, with a more possitive note.
"I finished the gear-system I've been working on for the past few weeks, and it runs like a charm!" 
Excitement had taken over the grim mood - he hadn't even had time to talk to Yurgunn about it.

"It's silent, takes up way less space that anything we've previously made, and everything just fits.
It's..." he looked up towards the always caring mother of his, and inhaled to finish:

"It's the best thing I've ever made, and worthy of my legacy."

"Legacy?" his mother said in an amused and questioning tone, as she stood up, and went back to the stove.
"Sweet, sweet child of mine - you are 20 years old, and creates something new each moon cycle.
If this is to be your legacy, what will you spend the rest of your time doing?"
She picked up the spoon, and stirred in the stewpot.

"Well, one of my achievements then" Adrex corrected himself.
"But we got this new client today, and he didn't want something we normally create.
He wants a *mobile* trap."

Adrex waited for his mother to ask for details, just as his father walked into the room.

"A mobile trap, hm? 
He wants to carry a plate around with him, which has a crossbow pointing towards itself?" 
He greeted his son with a double tap on the shoulder, as he continued towards his wife, kissing her at her cheek, while Adrex' eye rolled a round for the dump dad-joke.
His dad put his head towards the stewpot, and took a deep breath through his nose.

"Smell like a lovely wife, and a lovely dinner" he said, as he placed both of his hands at her hips, moving them from side to side in a small dance.
"What are we having tonight?"

Adrex rolled his eyes another round.
*Yes, that is somehow cute, but please, dad - every night?*
But apparently his mother loved it.

"It's juniper stew, and I've added some rosary peas for flavor - just like old times" she said with a small chuckle.

His dad made a noise, that sounded almost like a purr from a cat.

"Ahh - spicy. 
I love it!"

"How was your day, dad?" Adrex asked.

Nadraa turned around from his wife, and pulled a stool out as well.
"Not too bad, I should say.
Warden Poppin Drokrusher came by for his desk, saw it, and ordered both a new chair, and a new cane."

His low voice changed to a higher registry. 
"The handle must be exact", he said, imitating the grumpy, old gnome taking care of Gearhold Prison.

Adrex couldn't help but chuckle a bit.
That gnome had had the most ridicules requirements for the table - all sorts of finesses and details had to be engraved into it.
And although Nadraa had written each of them down, handed the notes to the gnome to review, the gnome had still repeated each of the lines, ending each of them with "and do so properly".
They all knew why he had emphasized it, but they had also learned to turn the 
rough to the smooth. 
Also, there were no customers if you always yelled at them, and most of them actually came back because they had good a experience doing business.

"Did he go over everything again this time?" Adrex asked a bit tired, though hoping for a laugh.

His dad gave a slight chuckle.
"For the chair, he just looked over the list, back at me, back to the list and nodded while mumbling it."
His dad loved to tell these kind of stories.

"For the cane however, he kept saying 'but it must fit *my* hand', and of cause it should.
So I took out some clay, made him squeeze it - haha."

*Clay?* Adrex thought to himself.

"He wasn't exactly pleased, but when I told him I now had a mold for his exact hand, he started looking frantically at the chair, to which I had to ensure him he didn't have to sit in clay."

Adrex gave a laugh just imagining the look on the gnome's face.

"So, will you just carve from a huge block and then get the handle right afterwards?" Adrex asked.

Nadraa shuck with his shoulders.
"I don't think I can water bend it.
The handle won't be able to... handle... it" he said, winking his right eye.

Adrex shut his eyes.
"Dad - please, I-I'm..."

He had a bit of trouble saying it.
It was actually a little funny.

"I'm trying to help you here."

Nadraa placed an elbow on the table, rest his head in his hand.
"Go on then.
Lets see if I can get a... grip... of it." he said, giving a smirk on his face.

*There are no end to these silly jokes*, Adrex thought to himself, as he pulled up the notebook he always carried in his satchel, along with a pen.
As he placed in on the table, he started explaining with a few drawings on an empty page;

"Let's say you have the handle here" Adrex said, drawing a rectangle in the book.
"If you drill a hole from the bottom of the handle and up, you should be able to attach a stick to it."

Adrex turned the book around, and pushed it towards his father.

"This way you'll save a lot of wood" he finished.

As his dad looked at it, he said "yes, but the the stick would fall out, right?" not exactly impressed.

"Right..." Adrex said, pulling the book back, tapping the back of his pen a few times at the page.
"Then you could place the stick in the hole, drill a hole through the side of the handle and the stick, and place a pin in it" he said, drawing a small circle in the middle of the stick.

His dad started nodding a bit.

"That... could save me a lot of wood.
And the stick could be replaced, should it break, right?" realizing what this could lead to.

"Yeah, or if the warden wants another type of wood, he can still keep the handle.
Or if he wants to be fancy, he can replace the handle, and keep the sticks!"

Nadraa sat there for a short moment of time, staring befuddled at Adrex.
"Where do you get all these ideas from, son?"

"If he gets them from food, we might have a few more this evening" his mother injected, as she placed the steaming pot on the middle of the table.

"Could you get the plates, dear?" she said to Adrex.

**NOT DONE YET**.
