Adrex was sitting in the shop with his notebook and a pencil, tabbing the top corner of the blank arc.
The deal he had struck with the twins were rather simple: he would get the formula for black powder, and he would find out how long it would take for the explosive part to be at its maximum height.
But that was tricky, for some reason.

He put down the pencil, and took the apple next him, tossing it up a few inches, mentally tracking how long it took for the apple to land in his hand.
He used a bit more force, tossing the apple a bit higher into the air, noting the time from leaving his hand to grabbing it was longer.

That made sense.
More power, more height, longer time.
And he wasn't really interested in how long it took to fall down again, since that would be too late for this purpose.
So all Adrex had to do, was find the time it took to get the apple up.

He looked at the iron stamp which held some loose parchments down, and then looked back at the apple in his hand.

*The heavier the object I send up, the more power I need*, he thought to himself.
He had had harder problems before, so this just needed a lot of testing.

He put the apple down, picked up his pencil, and wrote "light ball" in the top of the pater, and "heavy ball" halfway down the paper.
Then he drew two arrows under each line - one horizontal, one vertical - wrote "powder" under the horizontal line, and "height" at the vertical line.
He started tapping his pencil at the corner again, as he rested his head in left hand.

*So, if I use no powder, I won't get anywhere - that's for sure* he thought to himself, as he made a small cross where the lines met.

*And if I use a lot of powder, I will get high up* he murmured to himself, as he made another mark at the opposite end of where the lines met.
He started at the paper.
He couldn't quite predict if it would be a straight line from the first mark to the second, or if the line would bend upwards or downwards.
