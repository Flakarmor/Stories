Adrex was sitting relaxed in the shop with his notebook and a pencil, tabbing the top corner of the blank arc.
The deal he had struck with the twins were rather simple: he would get the formula for black powder, and he would find out how long it would take for the explosive part to be at its maximum height when shot up.
But that was tricky, for some reason.

He put down the pencil, and took the apple next him, tossing it up a few inches, mentally tracking how long it took for the apple to land in his hand.
He used a bit more force, tossing the apple a bit higher into the air, noting the time from leaving his hand to grabbing it was longer.

No surprise.
That made sense.
More power - more height - longer travel time.
And he wasn't really interested in how long it took to fall down again, since that would be too late for this purpose.
So all Adrex had to do, was find the time it took to get the apple up.

He looked at the iron stamp which held some loose parchments down, and then looked back at the apple in his hand.

*The heavier the object I send up, the more power I need*, he thought to himself.
He had had harder problems before, so this just needed a lot of testing.

He put the apple down, picked up his pencil, and wrote "light ball" in the top of the paper, and "heavy ball" halfway down the paper.
Then he drew two arrows under section - one horizontal, one vertical - wrote "powder" under the horizontal line, and "height" at the vertical line.
He started tapping his pencil at the corner again, as he rested his head in left hand.

*So, if I use no powder, I won't get anywhere - that's for sure*, he thought to himself, as he made a small cross where the lines met.

*And if I use a lot of powder, I will get high up*, he murmured to himself, as he made another mark at the opposite end of where the lines met.
He stared at the paper.
He couldn't quite predict if it would be a straight line from the first mark to the second, or if the line would bend upwards or downwards.
Well, no need to glare at this for too long.
He needed to test it anyway, but it would have been nice to have an idea of what to expect.

He closed his notebook just as the door swung up with the sound of the little bell, as Yurgunn and the gnome, Cleff Tinkertop, came through the door.
His black bush of a beard was easy to recognize, with small patches of white-gray hair here and there, with large spectacles in front of his eyes with extra lenses to flip in front of as well.
His tucked up shirt underneath his brown apron told Adrex, that the gnome didn't care that much about his appearances around other tinkers, cause there was business to be had.

As they stepped inside, Yurgunn sent a determined look towards Adrex - she had most likely made a good sales pitch, and now Adrex just had to seal the deal.
Adrex stood up, as the gnome noticed Adrex was there.

"Ah, Adrex me' boy - good to see you again" the gnome said with a genuine delight.
"How is it clickin'?"

Adrex adored the gnome.
He was a bit like Adrex himself in a way; 
If you could tinker a bit with the items, you could make something new of it.

"Mister Tinkertop" Adrex said, though happy to see him, not fully focused.
"Good to see you as well.
I assume Yurgunn have told you of our latest concept?"

The fuzzy eyebrows of the gnome made a small jump, as his right eye narrowed Adrex.

"Ey - and it really sounds like you had the... 'wheels turning'... for this one, eh?" he said, as he blinked to Adrex.

Adrex smiled, looking to Yurgunn who gave him a big grin.
He opened the door to the back room, and showed Cleff in to the setup he had shown Yurgunn earlier.

After the demonstration, Cleff was clearly impressed, as he inspected one of the small wheels in his hand, with an extra lens in front of his spectacles.

"So precise..." he muttered, before he turned his attention to Adrex.
"It must have taken a lot of attempts to make them fit?" 
The question was both of curiosity but also of wonder.

Adrex couldn't help but smile, as this was actually a huge compliment for him, before he shook his head.

"It took two attempts, before I got it right" he said, as he picked up the largest of the wheels.
He pointed towards one of the cogs, as he started to explain:

"The individual cogs are not just a tooth. 
They have very precise angles".
He pointed to the edge, before continuing:

"But it's not just an angle from the edge and inwards.
From the very tip is a rounding, which ensures the wheels spin as smooth as they can, and each cog's length and width are very precisely carved."

Cleff sent him a look of disbelief, as he adjusted a lens to better see the wheel he was holding.
Adrex fetched his notebook, as he turned to one of the latest pages which explained the math with detailed drawings.
He put the notebook down in front of Cleff, as he pushed it across the table.
The gnome started tracing written text with a finger, as he nodded, made a halt to think, nodded again, and continued through the notes.

After a few minutes, he finally uttered the words: 
"I see...", not taking his eyes from the pages and the wheel in his hand.
"Most fascinating, Adrex", he continued, as he flipped a page.
"I can't leave this place without a copy of these notes, rest assured.
I have plans already" the determined gnome said, perhaps most to himself.

He flipped another page, which landed him on the second most recent, which had two words underlined at the very top:

***Black powder***

The gnome froze with the flipped page still between two fingers, as Adrex tried to grab the book from him, gently pulling it away.

"Ah" Adrex started.
"That was... not-"

But he was interrupted by a serious index finger from Cleff, pointing straight into the air in front of him.

"Two things" he said, as precise as a soldier could shout commands.

"First, I am sorry to have been looking too far in your notes.
I thought there was more belonging to this".
He held a small pause before he continued.

"Second - that is dangerous stuff to be tampering with, me' boy".

Yurgunn stood at the side of the table, with her companion to her right side, and client and long time friend to her left, with a very concerned though hard expression on her face.

She snatched the notebook from Adrex' hand, and she flipped to the page in question.

"What do you mea-"
She stopped as she saw the words underlined.

There was a moment of silence, as she looked from the dragonborn to the gnome.
She raised her head a bit, as she said with confidence:
"We have dealt with worse before, such as lethal poison, you know".

Cleff took off his glass, and pulled out a cloth to clean them.

"It is not the powder I will warn you about, me dear." 
He took a breath as he found a seat, putting his spectacles on again with a small tremor.

"Adrex - what do you know about the group called 'Vox Machina'?"

Although only said as a simple question, the words sent a shiver down Adrex' spine. 

"Eh, they were the ones who defeated Vecna almost 20 years ago, right?"
He hadn't heard a lot about them, and what he had heard was conflicting.
It was an odd group of *very* powerful adventures, who had traveled the continent of Tal'dorei, apparently slaying dragons and the demigod, which sounded crazy had it not been for hardcore facts to back it up.

"Indeed, they did.
Now, they had a range of different abilities to do what they did - each of them strong in their own way" Cleff continued.

"One of them had a long metal stick, which were often referred to as 'a boomstick'.
He actually had several with him, to be precise."
His tone had reached a low registry.

"The short ones he called 'guns', and the long ones he called 'rifles'.
I don't know how they work, but I know that this is a requirement for them to work.
And I know of this -" he pointed to the notebook in Yurgunn's hand, "- since I know the son of the man who sold this exact compound to them."

There was a only a faint breath to be heard in the room, before the gnome spoke again.

"... and I believe you know that son's two daughters" he finished with a small smile in his right cheek.

*Daughters?* Adrex thought to himself.
*Two of those... that can only be...*

A stammer from Adrex uttered: 
"Y-you mean... Victoria and S-Smearchuckle?"

The dwarf pushed a stool to Adrex, as she took a seat on her own.
She tried to clarify it:

"Are yeh' say'n, tha' the two girls' grandpa' sold-" she waved the book twice in front of her "-to Lord Percival d' Rolo himself?" with a small disbelief and accusation.

Cleff made a small nod as his fussy eyebrows shot up, his lips tight.

Adrex couldn't get his head around it.

"Why is that bad? 
It sounds like quality!?" he said bewildered.

Cleff's eyes darted back to Adrex.

"Quality, indeed, me' boy.
And nothing wrong with it." 
He took a deep breath, and narrowed his eyes.

"The story goes, however, that their grandfather ones sold some of it to a woman, who had stolen one of these guns. 
And based on that information, Vox Machina tracked her down, and killed her on the spot."

Both Yurgunn and Adrex was as locked in place, and didn't take their eyes off the gnome. 
Almost simultaneously they swallowed, before Yurgunn asked with worry:
"Just 'cause she ha' one o' his... guns, was e'?"

Cleff gave a half nod, half turn with his head.

"Something about them being very dangerous in the wrong hands, I think" he said, with his gaze down into table with the wheels.

"But hunt her down, they did... almost twenty years ago."

He looked back up at the two.

"I don't know what you intent to make, but you make traps", he said with monotone voice.
"Be careful about what you do with it."

<Cleff leaves the two, stating he agrees to the price>
