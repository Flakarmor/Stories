Adrex was sitting relaxed in the shop with his notebook and a pencil, tabbing the top corner of the blank arc.
The deal he had struck with the twins were rather simple: he would get the formula for black powder, and he would find out how long it would take for the explosive part to be at its maximum height.
But that was tricky, for some reason.

He put down the pencil, and took the apple next him, tossing it up a few inches, mentally tracking how long it took for the apple to land in his hand.
He used a bit more force, tossing the apple a bit higher into the air, noting the time from leaving his hand to grabbing it was longer.

That made sense.
More power, more height, longer time.
And he wasn't really interested in how long it took to fall down again, since that would be too late for this purpose.
So all Adrex had to do, was find the time it took to get the apple up.

He looked at the iron stamp which held some loose parchments down, and then looked back at the apple in his hand.

*The heavier the object I send up, the more power I need*, he thought to himself.
He had had harder problems before, so this just needed a lot of testing.

He put the apple down, picked up his pencil, and wrote "light ball" in the top of the pater, and "heavy ball" halfway down the paper.
Then he drew two arrows under section - one horizontal, one vertical - wrote "powder" under the horizontal line, and "height" at the vertical line.
He started tapping his pencil at the corner again, as he rested his head in left hand.

*So, if I use no powder, I won't get anywhere - that's for sure*, he thought to himself, as he made a small cross where the lines met.

*And if I use a lot of powder, I will get high up*, he murmured to himself, as he made another mark at the opposite end of where the lines met.
He stared at the paper.
He couldn't quite predict if it would be a straight line from the first mark to the second, or if the line would bend upwards or downwards.
Well, no need to glare at this for too long.
He needed to test it anyway, but it would have been nice to have an idea of what to expect.

He closed his notebook just as the door swung up with the sound of the little bell, as Yurgunn and the gnome, Cleff Tinkertop, came through the door.
His black bush of a beard was easy to recognize, with small patches of white-gray air here and there, with large spectacles in front of his eyes with extra lenses to flip in front of as well.
His tucked up shirt underneath his brown apron told Adrex, that the gnome didn't care that much about his appearances around other tinkers, cause there was business to be had.

As they stepped inside, Yurgunn sent a determined look towards Adrex - she had most likely made a good sales pitch, and now Adrex just had to seal the deal.
Adrex stood up, as the gnome noticed Adrex was there.

"Ah, Adrex me' boy - good to see you again" the gnome said with a genuine delight.
"How is it clickin'?"

Adrex adored the gnome.
He was a bit like Adrex himself in a way. 
If you could tinker a bit with the items, you could make something new of it.

"Mister Tinkertop" Adrex said, though happy to see him, not fully focused.
"Good to see you as well.
I assume Yurgunn have told you of our latest concept?"

The fuzzy eyebrows of the gnome made a small jump, as his right eye narrowed Adrex.

"Ey - and it really sounds like you had the... 'wheels turning'... for this one, eh?" he said, as he blinked to Adrex.

Adrex smiled, looking to Yurgunn who gave him a big grin.
He opened the door to the back room, and showed Cleff in to the setup he had shown Yurgunn earlier.

After the demonstration, Cleff was clearly impressed, as he inspected one of the small wheels in his hand, with an extra lens in front of his spectacles.

"So precise..." he muttered, before he turned his attention to Adrex.
"It must have taken a lot of attempts to make them fit?" 
The question was both of curiosity but also of wonder.

Adrex couldn't help but smile, as this was actually a huge compliment for him, before he shook his head.

"It took two wheels, before I got it right" he said



* Adrex shows things
* Cleff sees them, and asks for notes
* Cleff sees the "black powder" written, and with concern asks, if they know it's not entirely legal in some aspects.
