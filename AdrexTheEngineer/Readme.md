# Adrex, the Engineer [Working title]

What would happen, if an immigrant from [Draconia](http://criticalrole.wikia.com/wiki/Draconia) grew up as an engineer, was sent to present his latest inventions for a military general, and must flee because of a misunderstanding?

## How this story came about

I play Dungeons & Dragons - mainly as the Dungeon Master, which means I don't get to play characters as much as I like.
One day I sat down and created a random character, thought he might needed a bit of a background story...
And suddenly I had too much for a "background" story.
